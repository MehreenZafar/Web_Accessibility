        <h1>Why is Web Accessibility so Important? </h1>
        <p>There are 2 billion people in the world who are disabled. Accessibility is the basic right of
            <br>people with disabilities to use web in a way that others perceive, understand, and use.
            <br>Accessibility is a lot more than the ability to see content on your screen. It’s a principle
            <br> that ensures all people with disabilities can interactin a way that communicates effectively
            <br>and safely with a computer, software, and web application. Unfortunately, many sites are
            <br> not accessible and many people are not aware of it. We can make the world a better place for
            <br>everyone by making websites accessible.
